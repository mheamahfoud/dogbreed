# Dog Breed Classifier


Welcome to the Dog Breed Classifier project! This Django web application utilizes a custom deep learning model trained with transfer learning to classify dog breeds based on input images.

## Custom Model

The custom model used in this project has been trained using transfer learning. Transfer learning involves taking a pre-trained model (in this case, likely a model trained on a large dataset like ImageNet) and fine-tuning it on a smaller dataset specific to the task at hand (classifying dog breeds).
